# Introduction

The ARC GNU Eclipse IDE consists of the Eclipse IDE combined with an Eclipse CDT Managed Build Extension plug-in for the ARC GNU Toolchain and GDB embedded debugger plug-in for ARC, based on the Zylin Embedded CDT plug-in. 
The ARC GNU IDE supports the development of managed C/C++ applications for ARC processors using the ARC GNU toolchain for bare metal applications (elf32).  

The ARC GNU IDE provides support for the following functionality: 
•	Support for Windows Development Host Systems
•	Support for the ARC EM Processor development target
•	Ability to create C/C++ projects using the ARC elf32 cross-compilation toolchain
•	Configuration of toolchain parameters per project
•	Configuration of individual options (such as preprocessor, optimization, warnings, libraries, and debugging levels) for each toolchain component:
o	arc-elf32-gcc
o	arc-elf32-gdb
o	arc-elf32-as
o	arc-elf32-size
•	Configuration of debug and run configurations for EM Starter Kit using OpenOCD. 
•	Configuration of debug and run configurations for supported FPGA Development Systems and debug probes (Digilent HS1 or Ashling Opella-XD).
•	GDB-based debugging using **Debug **perspective providing detailed debug information (including breakpoints, variables, registers, and disassembly)
